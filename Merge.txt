In my processor merge did automatically. But in manually, we can edit the conflicted file on VS code or other code editor. In VS code when we open current directory/ file. and try to merge it will show the difference with 2 branches(red and green colors) and ask with side change you want. Then we have to choose right/left and apply. after that step conflict will solved and we can merge
